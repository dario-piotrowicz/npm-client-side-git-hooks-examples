npm run pretty-quick

# "npm run pretty-quick" works nicely, but if for some reasons
# (issues with node versions or reluctance to add dev dependencies for example)
# you'd want to avoid it and use prettier directly you could do so by running
# prettier on the staged files instead. Unfortunately that would not be enough
# though, since pretty-quick not only formats the staged files but also re-add
# them to the commit, with just prettier the files would get formatted but not
# be included in the commit (I would imagine it should be able to write a script
# which after the formatting re-adds the files to the commit, but for the sake
# of semplicity I just used pretty-quick here, which in any case also seems to
# be the most popular way to implement this behavior)
